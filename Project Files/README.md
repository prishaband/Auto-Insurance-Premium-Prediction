# DSCI 441 Project - Auto Insurance Premium Prediction
Author: Prisha Bandyopadhyay

---

## Project Description
This project aims to predict auto insurance premiums using a synthetic dataset designed to mimic real-world insurance data.  
The goal is to explore how customer attributes such as age, marital status, prior insurance history, and claims frequency influence premium amounts.  
We apply machine learning techniques like Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) to develop predictive models.

Through this project, we demonstrate how machine learning can be leveraged for risk assessment and premium optimization in the insurance industry.  
Using a synthetic dataset ensures realistic experimentation without compromising privacy.

## Methodology
1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing**
   - Handled missing values, encoded categorical variables, and standardized numerical features.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Analyzed feature distributions, performed hypothesis testing, and studied correlations with premium amounts.
3. **Addressing Multicollinearity**
   - Used correlation matrices and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce redundancy among features.
4. **Model Development**
   - Built Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, and K-Nearest Neighbors models.
5. **Model Evaluation**
   - Evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (RÂ²) metrics.
6. **Insights**
   - Identified key drivers of premiums such as `Policy_Adjustment`, `Claims_PCA`, and `Credit_PCA`.
7. **Next Steps**
   - Suggest hyperparameter tuning and exploring advanced models like Random Forest and XGBoost.
